# How we engineer at Prenda

A living record.

Documentation created using Docusaurus. You can view and edit the code on the [Github Repo](https://github.com/prenda-school/prenda-school.github.io)

Feel free to open pull requests to add new pages or update current pages. We want to to be a collaborative document that helps us work better together.

Check out our [engineering team principles](./Engineering Practices/how-we-engineer)

Documents can live elsewhere and be linked here. We'll probably organize them better, but for now here's
