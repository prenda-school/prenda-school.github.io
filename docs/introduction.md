The Engineering Team governs, creates, maintains, manages, and supports Prenda’s technical solutions by:

* Establishing and maintaining architectural principles and best practices that include a consistent approach to systems & data
* Governing data and its flows to ensure accuracy, security, and destruction
* Ensuring security is considered at every level to protect Prenda from malfunctions and bad actors
* Collaborating with Product Management and Product Design to scope and deliver solutions that meet business objectives and users’ needs
* Monitoring system performance, uptime, and responding to system failures
