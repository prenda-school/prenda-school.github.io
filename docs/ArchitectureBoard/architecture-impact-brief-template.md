# Architecture Impact Brief


# Purpose

When a project is prioritized by the Product Steering Committee for execution it must be assessed by its lead engineer in collaboration with their team and product manager for its impact on enterprise system and data architecture. Should a [reasonable threshold](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/167U8vC_FWK6vLUbhuxGzCcUmXyo5jcKqtPg3UcB0QEg/edit) for formal review by the Architecture Board be met, the information requested in this document must be provided (in any format preferred and adequate for communicating the information) and scheduled for an architecture review. 


# [Project Title]

# Problem Statement

[What problem(s) are being addressed by this project? Please explain the problem and include its existing effects on the overall system and any users. Describe the root cause of the problem in as much detail as possible.]


# Proposed Solution

[Describe the solution with emphasis on the application and data architectural changes being proposed. How will these changes address the problem? What are the potential benefits of the changes? (Scalability, security, improved performance, reduction of user friction, etc.)]


# Implementation Plan

[Please provide a high-level description of the steps required to implement the proposed changes. If other teams or domains are affected please include a discussion of the proposed communication and collaboration strategy.]


# Impact Analysis

[Describe the impact of the proposed changes on existing systems, applications, designs, components, and integrations. What are the risks associated with the changes? How will they be mitigated? What other teams will be affected by the changes?] 

[Please include details related to applications and data stores involved (Hub, MongoDB, Prenda World, etc.), and data flows affected. List the API endpoints to be added/deleted/modified, along with a thorough inventory of other applications and processes that integrate with them.]
