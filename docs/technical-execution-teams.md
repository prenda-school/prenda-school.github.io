# Technical Execution Teams Prioritization and Approach


### _Nov 16, 2022 - Due to organization changes, there will be changes to this approach and document coming soon from the Product Management Team. ~Monte_


##### Updated November 2022


## Overview

Technical Execution Teams (“execution teams” or “teams”) discover, design, build, update, integrate, and maintain Prenda’s technical solutions, with a focus on custom-built/integrated systems that support Guides, Students, Parents, and Employees. There are three types of roles that support the execution team:



* Product Manager - Primary liaison between the execution team and other stakeholders, including the broader Squad and groups like Customer Care, Marketing, and Learning.
* Software Engineers - Between two and six engineers that do the coding, automated testing, deployment, and support of software.
* Product Designer - Supports the team’s work by breaking down problems into simple and intuitive solutions for users.


## Prioritization of Initiatives

Initiatives are areas of focus centered on desired outcomes, questions, and/or business problems. Teams assuming ownership over an initiative take on discovery, design, and delivery of solutions that impact the desired outcome. Initiative work typically looks like:



* Discovery and definition of the problem.
* Defining user outcomes of desired change in human behavior that drives business results[^1]. Users can be internal or external to the organization.


* Design of a solution that creates an altered or new experience through technology, policy, messaging, etc.
* Delivery of a response or solution to the problem and desired user outcome.


### Standard Approach

Prioritization happens at three levels within the business: 



* Company level – through the Objective and Key Results setting process
* Group level – through the Product Management Team Initiative Prioritization process
* Team level – through the Execution Team Stakeholder Prioritization process

The Product Management Team supports the organization as a whole and, more directly, the collective group of Technical Execution Teams, Architecture Guild, and Squads. As a team, the Product Managers meet every two weeks to review existing prioritization and progress on initiatives, review and discuss newly identified initiatives, and then recommend changes to priorities for further discussion with execution teams. Adjusted priorities are then communicated to business stakeholders and company leaders. As part of this process, domains and recommended team assignment is defined. 

New initiative opportunities can be identified and recommended by anyone in the company by using the [New Company Initiative Ideas Form](https://form.asana.com/?k=qHBx2TzU4bIUrQNRXuYJww&d=995455616843969).

New initiative ideas or opportunities can be identified and proposed by anyone in the company using the [New Company Initiative Form](https://form.asana.com/?k=qHBx2TzU4bIUrQNRXuYJww&d=995455616843969), upvote existing ideas using Asana “Like” functionality, or add commentary on existing ideas on the [New Ideas and Opportunities](https://app.asana.com/0/1202955569621410/1202955569621410) Asana Board. These initiatives are then reviewed by the PM team and then formally discussed every two weeks in company prioritization review meetings that include key stakeholders and company leaders.

Targeted initiatives then translate to [Company-wide Initiatives](https://app.asana.com/0/1202955569621460/1202955569621460) board (shared board that represents initiatives that live on specific teams (i.e., an initiative “card” lives on two boards for documentation). Each running team has an associated tactical implementation board to track work and progress that rolls up to the [Company-wide Initiatives](https://app.asana.com/0/1202955569621460/1202955569621460) board. 

After initial company prioritization and team assignment, individual Product Managers facilitate a team-level prioritization process in review of the team’s current work and taking into account additional user(s) and key stakeholder perspectives typically in the form of a standing meeting that is short and focused only on prioritization, not discovery or solutionizing. The discussion at such meetings includes:



1. Review of recently completed initiatives
2. Update on in-flight initiatives
3. Consideration of new initiatives
4. Changes to existing prioritized initiatives

After each meeting or prioritization change decision, the Product Management Team and individual Product Managers will summarize the changes made—priorities or scope changes—and post the update to the associated public squad channel and cross-post a link to #org-exp and #steering-committee channels.


### Priority Meeting Schedule

Company Initiative Prioritization Reviews are scheduled and facilitated by the Product Management team:_ _Every other Tuesday at 10 AM MT.  \

_Each team working board is cross-linked to the _**[Company-wide Initiatives](https://app.asana.com/0/1202955569621460/1202955569621460)_ board._



* [Company-wide Initiatives](https://app.asana.com/0/1202955569621460/1202955569621460)

When the initiatives interrupt other prioritized initiatives, then the Product Manager team or the individual product manager summarizes the impact which is communicated to impacted key stakeholders, presented at the next Steering Committee, and a posted summary to during weekly product management summary report in #org-exp.


### Bugs

If you think you’ve encountered a bug in one of our systems, you can report it using the steps below:



1. Employees complete the [Prenda Issue Reporting Form (Internal)](https://share.hsforms.com/1JZigPNIQToGmr6AK1i7Xggcei9n)
2. Form submission creates a [ticket in Hubspot for Customer Support](https://app.hubspot.com/contacts/20832251/objects/0-5/views/all/board) for analysis, collapsing, and potential escalation.
3. If escalated, tickets are moved in Hubspot to the [Internal Issues & Bugs board](https://app.hubspot.com/contacts/20832251/objects/0-5/views/all/board) and a card is created in the [PM Bug Tracking board in Asana](https://app.asana.com/0/1202607194020840/board).
4. PMs review the Asana cards and assign the issue to a team (or not).
