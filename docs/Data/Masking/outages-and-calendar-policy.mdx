# Masked data for local developer use

##### Last updated January 30, 2023

Masked data is a copy of the production data set where the PII data has been replaced with fake content. It still maps the real relationships between content to create a realistic data set to work with.

This includes duplicates, idiosyncrasies and other oddities our production data has. Which allows us to run migration scripts and get close to production results from the outputs.

## Prenda World
